- problem 1 (sum of multiples of 3 & 5): happy
- problem 2 (sum of even fib < 4*10e6): pretty happy, could look for
  more efficiency
- problem 3 (prime factors): need to actually factor
- problem 4 (palindromes): want to make more efficient (better than n^2)

[more notes needed in here!]

- problem 14: Solved, but I'd like to do a cleaner implementation.
- problem 18: Solved and I'm satisfied.
- problem 67: Same as for 18 (same problem, different data)
